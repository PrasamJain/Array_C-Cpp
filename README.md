Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 
An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.

# Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows âˆ’
          
        type arrayName [ arraySize ];

# Initializing Arrays

        int arr[10] = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 }
        int arr[] = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 }
        
Accessing Array Elements  

arr[8];      //9

Allocation - 
we can allocate array using static memory and dynamic memory allocation.
